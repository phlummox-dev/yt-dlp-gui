## Usage

There are two ways to get started, depending on your preference and system:

* [`Portable`](#portable) ~ *Windows*
* [`Manual`](#manual) ~ *Platform independent*

### Portable

Download the latest portable version from the the [releases](https://github.com/dsymbol/yt-dlp-gui/releases/latest) section. 
This is a ZIP file containing the program files and all necessary dependencies.

*All releases are built and released using GitHub Workflow*

### Manual

You **must** have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9+ installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dsymbol/yt-dlp-gui
cd yt-dlp-gui
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd app
python app.py
```

## Preset Customization

**Note:** all files mentioned below are located in the root directory of the program.

If you want to create your own presets or modify the existing ones, you're in the right place. All customization options can be found in the `config.toml` file.

###  Available Fields

To define a preset, the section name must begin with `presets.`. Below are the fields you can use to customize your presets:

- **args** (required): This field can be provided as a string or a list. The arguments specified here will be added onto the [base](https://github.com/dsymbol/yt-dlp-gui/blob/main/app/worker.py#L67) `yt-dlp` arguments. Therefore only the format and other relevant options for downloading should be specified.

- **path** (optional): This string field allows you to specify the output path. If this field is left out, it must be included in the `args` field.

- **filename** (optional): This string field allows you to define the naming convention. If this field is left out, it must be specified in the `args` field.

- **sponsorblock** (optional): This integer field allows you to set SponsorBlock functionality. `0` to disable or `1` to remove and `2` to mark.

- **metadata** (optional): This boolean field determines whether to include metadata.

- **subtitles** (optional): This boolean field determines whether to include subtitles.

- **thumbnail** (optional): This boolean field determines whether to include thumbnail.

Below an example of how to add the `wav` format, you will notice I left out `subtitles` and `thumbnail` as they're not applicable for this format.

```toml
[presets.wav]
args = "--extract-audio --audio-format wav --audio-quality 0"
path = ""
filename = "%(title)s.%(ext)s"
sponsorblock = 0
metadata = false
```

Try it yourself by pasting it to the bottom of your `config.toml` file! You will see that any fields not included in the preset will be disabled in the GUI. If you encounter any issues with your preset, check the `debug.log` file for details.

## Troubleshooting

On Linux, you may see an error message similar to the following when you try to run the program:

> qt.qpa.plugin: From 6.5.0, xcb-cursor0 or libxcb-cursor0 is needed to load the Qt xcb platform plugin.   
> qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.   
> This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

This occurs because certain system libraries required by yt-dlp-gui are not installed if the program is
installed using `pip` or similar tools.

On Debian- or Ubuntu-based systems, running the following command will usually correct the problem:

```
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0
```

If it doesn't, the Qt documentation provides a [list of recommended packages][qt-x11-packages] to install on
Debian- and Ubuntu-based systems â€“ try installing those, and see if that resolves the issue.

[qt-x11-packages]: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux-requirements.html

On Fedora or RHEL-based systems, try:

```
sudo dnf install xcb-util-cursor
```
